Verilog-Project
Designed and Implemented Vehicle Entry Access Control:- Developed a robust vehicle entry access control system for a parking facility. Integrated a sensor at the entrance to detect incoming vehicles, prompting for a password input to grant access. Successfully designed the password verification mechanism, allowing authorized vehicles to enter while denying entry to unauthorized ones.

Realized Automated Locking Mechanism for Concurrent Entries:- Engineered an intelligent locking mechanism to handle simultaneous vehicle entries at the parking gate. When a vehicle is in the process of entering, and another vehicle approaches, the system automatically locks the gate, prompting the second vehicle to input the correct password before granting access. This solution prevents unauthorized access attempts during active entry operations.

Ensured Secure Parking Facility Operations:- Implemented security features to ensure the safety and integrity of the parking facility. The access control system effectively prevents unauthorized entry, minimizing the risk of unauthorized vehicle presence within the parking area. The project's design enhances overall parking facility management, providing a seamless and secure experience for both users and administrators.
